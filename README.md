## Professional Experience

### Full Stack Developer 
CLIENT: SAMS CLUB (DEC 2023 – PRESENT) LOCATION: BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS ROLE: JAVA FULL STACK DEVELOPER

At Sam’s Club, I worked on developing a Membership Management Portal as a Full Stack Developer. Using React.js and Redux, I designed responsive, user-friendly interfaces for member sign-ups, renewals, and dashboards. At the same time, the backend was built with Spring Boot and Node.js, ensuring secure APIs and efficient data processing. I managed databases using PostgreSQL for structured data and MongoDB for activity logs. The application was hosted on AWS, leveraging EC2, S3, and RDS, with CI/CD pipelines automated using Jenkins and containerized deployments with Docker. Additionally, I integrated Splunk for monitoring and New Relic for performance optimization, resulting in a highly scalable solution that reduced processing times by 40% and improved user satisfaction.
